  🚀 Axy DevOps Engineer Assignment Solution
  
📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete three-tier microservices application with:

Part 1: Local development using Docker Compose

Part 2: Production deployment on AWS using Infrastructure as Code

I built this solution from scratch, focusing on security, scalability, and best practices.

🎯 What's Inside
📦 Application Components
Frontend: HTML + JavaScript served via Nginx

Backend: Node.js + Express REST API

Database: PostgreSQL with persistent storage

🏗️ Infrastructure
Local: Docker Compose with private networking

Production: AWS with EC2 Auto Scaling, RDS, and Load Balancer

🖥️ Part 1: Local Development (Docker Compose)
✅ Quick Start (2 Minutes)
bash
# 1. Clone and navigate
git clone <repository-url>
cd axy-devops-assignment

# 2. Run everything
docker-compose up --build

# 3. Open browser: http://localhost:8080
🎮 What You'll See
Frontend webpage showing "Axy DevOps Assignment"

Real-time backend health status

Interactive "Get Message" button fetching data from PostgreSQL

All services running in isolated containers

Your Browser → Frontend (Nginx:8080) → Backend (Node.js:3000) → Database (PostgreSQL:5432)
🛡️ Security Features
✅ Only frontend exposed (port 8080)

✅ Backend/database in private Docker network

✅ Database not accessible from host

✅ Environment variables for sensitive data

✅ Health checks for all services

🏗️ Production Architecture
text
Internet Users
       ↓
[ Application Load Balancer ] ← HTTPS/HTTP, Health Checks
       ↓
[ Auto Scaling Group ] ← 2-4 EC2 instances (scales automatically)
       ↓
[ EC2 Instances (t3.small) ] ← Runs Docker containers with our app
       ↓
[ RDS PostgreSQL ] ← Multi-AZ, encrypted, daily backups
🚀 Deploy to AWS
bash
# 1. Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# 2. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 3. Plan deployment
terraform plan

# 4. Deploy everything
terraform apply

# 5. Get your application URL
terraform output alb_dns_name
# Open: http://<your-alb-url>
💰 Cost Optimized Design
EC2: t3.small instances with Auto Scaling (2-4)

RDS: db.t3.small with Multi-AZ for high availability

Load Balancer: Single ALB for cost efficiency

Monitoring: CloudWatch included for observability

🛡️ Production Security
🔒 Database in private subnet (no internet access)

🔒 EC2 instances in private subnet

🔒 Only Load Balancer is public-facing

🔒 Security groups with least privilege

🔒 Encrypted RDS storage

🔒 No SSH access from internet

🎯 API Endpoints
Local Development
text
GET http://localhost:8080/api/health

🔧 Testing & Verification
Local Testing
bash
# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/message

# Check container logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs database

bash
# After terraform apply
ALB_URL=$(terraform output -raw alb_dns_name)
curl http://$ALB_URL/api/health
curl http://$ALB_URL/api/message
⚡ Performance & Scaling
Auto Scaling Rules
Scale Up: When CPU > 70% for 5 minutes

Scale Down: When CPU < 30% for 5 minutes

Instance Range: 2 to 4 t3.small instances

High Availability
✅ Multi-AZ deployment (RDS)

✅ Load balancer health checks

✅ Auto-replacement of unhealthy instances

✅ Database failover capability

🧹 Cleanup
Local Environment
bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down -v

# Remove Docker volumes
docker volume prune -f
AWS Environment
bash
# Destroy all AWS resources
terraform destroy

# Confirm and remove
yes | terraform destroy
⚠️ Important: Running terraform destroy will delete all AWS resources to avoid ongoing charges.
